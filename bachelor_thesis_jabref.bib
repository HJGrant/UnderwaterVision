  abstract  = {Depth cameras are increasingly used in research and industry in underwater settings. However, cameras that have been calibrated in air are notably inaccurate in depth measurements when placed underwater, and little research has been done to explore pre-existing depth calibration methodologies and their effectiveness in underwater environments. We used four methods of calibration on a low-cost, commercial depth camera both in and out of water. For each of these methods, we compared the predicted distance and length of objects from the camera with manually measured values to get an indication of depth and length accuracy. Our findings indicate that the standard methods of calibration in air are largely ineffective for underwater calibration and that custom calibration techniques are necessary to achieve higher accuracy.},

  abstract   = {An approach to integrating stereo disparity, camera vergence, and lens focus to exploit their complementary strengths and weaknesses through active control of camera focus and orientations is presented. In addition, the aperture and zoom settings of the cameras are controlled. The result is an active vision system that dynamically and cooperatively interleaves image acquisition with surface estimation. A dense composite map of a single contiguous surface is synthesized by automatically scanning the surface and combining estimates of adjacent, local surface patches. This problem is formulated as one of minimizing a pair of objective functions. The first such function is concerned with the selection of a target for fixation. The second objective function guides the surface estimation process in the vicinity of the fixation point. Calibration parameters of the cameras are treated as variables during optimization, thus making camera calibration an integral, flexible component of surface estimation. An implementation of this method is described, and a performance evaluation of the system is presented. An average absolute error of less than 0.15\% in estimated depth was achieved for a large surface having a depth of approximately 2 m.{\textless}{\textgreater}},
